# Required environment
Tensorflow 1.X <br>
Numpy <br>
Opencv-python <br>
Pillow (PIL) <br>
# Required files and pretrained models
This model requires VGG19 model file for both training and inference. It can be downloaded from <https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LrQi-oJMqmE1--VjU8r03OEJd6XM4thc>. Put the downloaded vgg19.npy file into **vgg19_weight** directory for use.
